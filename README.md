**Circlejerky** is a chatbot made for Slack. Our beloved Circlejerky has following skills:

- He sends a random horse gif from GIPHY when **horse** is written in chat. Current trigger words are:
    - horse
    - ross
    - rössli
    - pferd
    - cheval
    - gaul
    - лошадь

  it also gets triggered when a other word (or emoji) contain the words. For example: a *:bob_ross:* emoji will trigger the horse gif

- He sends a random unicorn gif from GIPHY when **unicorn** is written in chat. Current trigger words are:
    - unicorn

  it also gets triggered when a other word (or emoji) contain the words.

- He sends a random sentence from a "co-worker" when **chef** is written in chat. Current trigger words are:
    - huere scheiss
    - stift
    - hode
    - wixxer
    - wixer
    - ceo
    - chef

  it also gets triggered when a other word (or emoji) contain the words.

- If the word **bojack** is written, the bot will return a random bojack GIF from GIPHY .

- If you type **earrape** or **earcancer** you will receive a wonderful song from youtube selected by the creators of the bot

- if you thank Circlejerky his response will be polite.

- but never offend our all beloved Circlejerky, he will not like it!

- And if you can't handle him anymore, just type following words: **stop dude!!**
